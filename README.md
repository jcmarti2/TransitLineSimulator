# TransitLineSimulator

## About this repository
This repository is holding the TransitLineSimulator class and is in-progress. It is a re-do (re-design and re-implementation of the TransitStopSimulator repository, which was just a class project).

This is a simulator of a transit line. Aspects like bus bunching, bus addition and stop slack are being modeled.
